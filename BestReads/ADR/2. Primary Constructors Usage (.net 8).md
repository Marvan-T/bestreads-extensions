# Using Primary Constructors in .NET 8

Primary constructors offer a compact approach for introducing dependencies into a class.

**Before:**

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/extensions/[controller]")]
public class BookRecommendationsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IBookRecommendationService _bookRecommendationService;

    public BookRecommendationsController(IBookRecommendationService bookRecommendationService)
    {
        _bookRecommendationService = bookRecommendationService;
    }
}
```

**After:**

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/extensions/[controller]")]
public class BookRecommendationsController(IBookRecommendationService bookRecommendationService) : ControllerBase
{
    // Controller implementation
}
```

While this approach is compact and elegant, it is important to realize that the constructor parameters are mutable.

**Alternative Approach Considered:**

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/extensions/[controller]")]
public class BookRecommendationsController(IBookRecommendationService bookRecommendationService) : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IBookRecommendationService bookRecommendationService = bookRecommendationService;
}
```

This alternative approach addresses the issue of mutability but results in warnings due to the violation of the
convention (the common convention is to prefix private instance fields with an underscore (_)). We could add
a `GlobalSuppressions.cs` file to suppress warnings related to this. However, I decided not to adopt this approach as
the IDE shortcuts still initialize the field with an underscore when initializing fields in this manner, requiring
manual removal of these underscores.

Given that this project is unit tested, we can be assured that any unintentional mutations should be caught by the
tests. Therefore, I have made the decision to use primary constructors under the following conditions:

- Use primary constructors if the class is unit tested.
- For **infrastructure classes**, stick to readonly properties until we have integration tests in place.
